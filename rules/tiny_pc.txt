Tiny PC Rules:
  You can squeeze into small spaces and occupy the same space as other creatures.
  You can use almost anything as cover.
  You can only wield light or finesse weapons. You can have smaller versions of normal weapons custom made but they will deal less damage.
  What is considered difficult terrain and its effects on you will be case-by-case.
